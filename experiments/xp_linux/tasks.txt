This is essentially my issue tracker. I might put together something more formal
but for now this will do.

===============================================================================
STATUS: WIP
command interpreter, ability to run a list of command in sequence. Currently
it's a bit clunky but it is possible. Need to improve. Ultimate aim would be to
instead just run kaem (from stage0-posix) but kaem relies on fork/exec/waitpid.

===============================================================================
STATUS: TODO
executables should be loaded from the virtual filesystem

STATUS: TODO
Reduce size of memory mapping.

Currently I do a 3.5 GiB linear memory map. This is problematic for several
reasons:

* 32 bit Linux can reseve that much contigiuous memory.
* win32 can't either, plus win32 also has the issue of not allowing overcommit
  (which means that doing a large allocation may fail if there is not enough
  physical/page file space to accomodate it in full).

Quick fix would be to just cut it down to 512MiB (still mmap fixed from a low
base address. Benefit of this is that the memory map could be identical across
all platforms.

Next best fix would be to do several fixed position reservations (still all
below 512MB upper address limit).

Or alternatively I could do a fixed allocation for the elf process memory/stack
and then do plain malloc allocations for other memory regions (eg files).

===============================================================================
STATUS: TODO
win32 port

Will have to use ideas similar to http://cowlark.com/lbw/ (but should be simpler
since I don't need to support stuff like thread local storage).

Has also previously been done under:

https://github.com/hackpascal/line-is-not-emulator (like WINE in reverse).

There's also another one but I can't think of its name atm, but iirc it was
relatively complete. I'll maybe manage to find it with Google, but Google isn't
being very helpful atm.

There's also stuff like usermode linux for win32. But my plan it to do it from
scratch.

There is some win32 library function you can call to trap int 0x80. In theory
I'll just need to use that.

===============================================================================
STATUS: TODO
fork/exec/waitpid.

This will allow me to run multiple processes. This will be needed to allow me
to run stage0-posix (or anything else that needs a command interpreter).

Implementation will be similar to builder-hex0 which does not use the MMU and
only supports cooperative multitasking (and a bunch of other restrictions). It
emulated fork by simply copying the process memory into a temporary location.
When the fork/execed process is done then the previously saved process memory is
restored from the temp location, and execution is resumed in the previous parent
process.

===============================================================================
STATUS: TODO
build pnut_js (and run it).

May need some form of mmap support, since I think pnut will mmap its heap. Can
probably patch use of mmap out if necessary.
