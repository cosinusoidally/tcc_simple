XP Linux (cross platform Linux)

The aim is to essentially create a "usermode linux lite" operating system that
is able to run a subset of Linux executables across a range of 32 bit x86
operating systems (including under win32).

Specifically I want to be able to run the initial stages of live-bootstrap all
the way up to fiwix in order to be able to emit a copy of the Tiny C compiler
and the fiwix kernel/bootdisk.

The initial stages of live-bootstrap run under an operating system written in
assembly language that is called builder-hex0. My first goal is to create a
usermode version of builder-hex0 that can run under Linux (rather than needing
to run under qemu, or on bare metal).
