tl;dr

./mk_m2min_v3

will bootstrap from nothing up to a statically linked version of tcc (based on
the live-bootstrap bootstrappable version of tcc).

This default bootstrap path will use the readable assembly language version of
m2min_v3.js (m2min_v3.M1). The m2min_v3.M1 file is assembled by M0 from the
stage0-posix project. All dependencies are in tree.

There are alternative diverse bootstrap paths available in this directory if
you do not wish to trust or manually audit m2min_v3.M1 (detailed below).

This default bootstrap path takes us up to tcc-boot-mes, which will be deposited
in ../artifacts/tcc-boot-mes . tcc-boot-mes is based on:

https://gitlab.com/janneke/tinycc/-/tree/mes-0.27?ref_type=heads

with patches from:

https://gitlab.com/janneke/tinycc/-/tree/mes-0.27?ref_type=heads

The actual version of bootstrappable tcc is from:

https://github.com/fosslinux/live-bootstrap/blob/master/steps/tcc-0.9.26/sources

which is currently:

https://lilypond.org/janneke/tcc/tcc-0.9.26-1147-gee75a10c.tar.gz 6b8cbd0a5fed0636d4f0f763a603247bc1935e206e1cc5bda6a2818bab6e819f tcc-0.9.26.tar.gz

This version is in tree (../tcc-0.9.26-lb/) and already has the patches applied.
