This file contains documentation for cjsawk.js . Since we want cjsawk.js to
simultaneously be valid C, JS, and AWK we cannot use C style comments (since
AWK comments are single line and start with a # symbol, which is not valid
JS or C).

frame_bias: this variable exists since main has an additional number of
            elements initially on the stack.

We have a function called "smatch" rather than "match" as match is a builtin
function in AWK and cannot be overriden. In general builin functions in AWK
cannot be redefined, this affects us in multiple places, eg there was a
function called "sub" which had to be changed to "SUB". Placeholder for builins:


* FIXME put list of builtins here *
