In function storePointer if we encounter a '>' , eg like this:

%ELF_program_headers>ELF_base

we insert the address of ELF_program_headers relative to ELF_base

In first_pass we detect lables (those start with ':'). We also deal with
pointers of different sizes:

1byte relative pointer !
4byte pointers: % for relative and & for absolute

The original version of hex2 can handle 2 byte and 3 byte pointers. I should
probably add back in support for 2 byte pointers as this will allow me to also
handle 16 bit x86 code.

In first_pass we also have to handle lable>base as in storePointer (in the
first pass we just discard them).


in main there are 2 passes:

first_pass: Get all of the labels
second_pass: Fix all the references

We then chmod:

Note we use chmod(output_filename, 488); /* 0750 */ as awk can't handle octal.
