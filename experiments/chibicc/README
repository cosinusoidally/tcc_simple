Note for now the builds are not deterministic unless you are on a Ubuntu 22.04
system with build essentials installed.

To set up a chroot:

sudo debootstrap --variant=buildd --arch=amd64 jammy jammy

cd jammy
sudo mount --bind /proc proc
sudo chroot .
apt-get install gcc-multilib (if this fails run "apt-get update" and try again)
adduser foo
su foo
cd

From outside the chroot place tcc_simple in foo's home directory inside the
chroot.

inside the chroot navigate to this directory.

./mk_orig should build the original version of chibicc
./mk_refactor should build the refactored version. Note this needs 32 bit
support libs and headers.

Watch out for errors. If the build is successful you will see:

mk_orig OK
or
mk_refactor OK
