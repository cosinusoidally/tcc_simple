Note for now the builds are not deterministic unless you are on a Ubuntu 22.04
system with build essentials installed.

The current lack of determinism is to do with the different include paths and
files that will vary between distributions. These paths find their way into the
assembly code. The assembly diffs are larger still because the differening
headers also cause differrences in the debug info (which is spread through the
whole assembly files).

The longer term fix to this issue is to ship headers (eg like I did with
tcc_bootstrap_alt).

To set up a chroot:

sudo debootstrap --variant=buildd --arch=amd64 jammy jammy

cd jammy
sudo mount --bind /proc proc
sudo chroot .
apt-get install gcc-multilib (if this fails run "apt-get update" and try again)
adduser foo
su foo
cd

From outside the chroot place tcc_simple in foo's home directory inside the
chroot.

inside the chroot navigate to this directory.

./mk_orig should build the original version of chibicc
./mk_refactor should build the refactored version. Note this needs 32 bit
support libs and headers.

Watch out for errors. If the build is successful you will see:

mk_orig OK
or
mk_refactor OK
