WIP cutdown simplified version of tcc-0.9.27 implemented in simple c dialect
and capable of building tcc_27. See also ../tcc_boot_min as tcc_boot_max will
follow a similer approach (see also commit history for tcc_boot_min).

tbh progress will probably be slow with tcc_boot_max as I'm currently
investigating an alternative path where I use a cutdown and simplified version
of chibicc in order to compile tcc_27.
