tcc_simple

This repo is essentially the v2 version of:

https://github.com/cosinusoidally/tcc_bootstrap_alt

The code in this repo is not complete yet, but the general plan is as follows:

Strip down The Tiny C Compiler (tcc-0.9.27) into 2 versions:

tcc_27_refactor - a cut down version of tcc-0.9.27 that is complete enough to
                  compile tcc-0.9.27
tcc_simple_c    - a cut down version of tcc_27_refactor that is only capable of
                  compiling a cut down version of the C language. Specifically
                  the language supported by M2_simple_asm.c (also included in
                  this repo).

Once tcc_simple_c and tcc_27_refactor are complete the next step is to create
2 bootstrap compilers:

tcc_boot_min - tcc_simple_c ported to the M2_simple_asm.c dialect. Will also be
               self hosted.
tcc_boot_max - tcc_27_refactor ported to the M2_simple_asm.c dialect. Will also
               be self hosted.
