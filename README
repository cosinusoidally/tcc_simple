tcc_simple

This repo is essentially the v2 version of:

https://github.com/cosinusoidally/tcc_bootstrap_alt

The code in this repo is not complete yet, but the general plan is as follows:

Strip down The Tiny C Compiler (tcc-0.9.27) into 2 versions:

tcc_27_refactor - a cut down version of tcc-0.9.27 that is complete enough to
                  compile tcc-0.9.27
tcc_simple_c    - a cut down version of tcc_27_refactor that is only capable of
                  compiling a cut down version of the C language. Specifically
                  the language supported by M2_simple_asm.c (also included in
                  this repo).

Once tcc_simple_c and tcc_27_refactor are complete the next step is to create
2 bootstrap compilers:

tcc_boot_min - tcc_simple_c ported to the M2_simple_asm.c dialect. Will also be
               self hosted.
tcc_boot_max - tcc_27_refactor ported to the M2_simple_asm.c dialect. Will also
               be self hosted.

The bootstrap process would then be as follows:

hex0          - A "compiler" for commented hex dumps. See tcc_bootstrap_alt,
                the hex tools are from stage0-posix
hex1          - A "compiler" for commented hex dumps with support for single
                character labels.
hex2          - similar to hex1 but has support for larger labels
M0            - A simple macro language used to implement a simple assembler
cc_x86        - a C compiler written in assembly (the version from
                tcc_bootstrap_alt). cc_x86_min.M1  or M2_simple_asm.M1 could
                also be used.
M2_simple_asm - a C compiler written in the "simple_c" dialect.
tcc_boot_min  - cut down version of tcc-0.9.27 implemented in the simple_c
                dialect. Implements the simple_c dialect.
tcc_boot_max  - cut down version of tcc-0.9.27 implemented in the simple_c
                dialect. Implements a large enough subset of C in order to
                to compile tcc-0.9.27.
tcc_27        - a nearly stock tcc-0.9.27 from tcc_bootstrap_alt . This version
                is capable of compiling a stock tcc-0.9.27. More importantly
                this version of tcc can also compile the GNU C compiler.
                Further, this version can even be plugged into live-bootstrap
                to replace the mescc steps.

For reference, fork of live-bootstrap that uses tcc_bootstrap_alt instead of mescc:
